This is a Proof of Concept for having the seat map be rendered using the React svg pan zoom library found <a href="https://github.com/chrvadala/react-svg-pan-zoom" target="_blank">here</a>

To do: 
- Add a call-to-action in the country card (load more data by hitting another endpoint)
- Look into not having the country card scale with the rest of the SVG
- Close country card button
- Create function to dertermine if user is dragging or not and handle each function appropriatley
- Contaxtual Map style for Context box
